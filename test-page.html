            <h2>A little About Me</h2>
            <p>A little about me, I’m Charlotte a 19 year old, Fully Qualified Beautician based in my own Fully Insured private salon in kingsmead, northwich. I offer all things nails,lashes,brow+lash tinting,facials (electric and non electric) and Swedish massage. I’m passionate about doing whatever I can to boost people’s confidence whether that’s a full set of lashes and nails or a little brow tidy. I specialise in putting the heath of my clients before anything, ensuring I’m giving them the best treatment possible! As does everyone I love a work/life balance, on my days off you’ll find me at the gym or surrounded by our many cats, who you can say hello to during your appointments if you wish! 
               If I sound like the right beautician for you pop me a message and we can get you booked in smoothly.</p>
